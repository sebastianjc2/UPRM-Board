# RUM BOARD
INSO4101/ICOM4009 Introduction to software enginnering

## Scope
The “RUM Board” project will consist of creating a platform where students can have a bulletin board and other features that can make their university experience better and more efficient. Our goal is that the platform created is accessible to all the students, this will be possible thanks to multiplatform tools like React Native. This platform will help the students in their daily life in the university with a diversity of tools. The main feature of the platform is a “bulletin board” of which it will output events and activities related to the university, it will also remind students of important days. The platform will have an integrated calendar that will be linked to Google's calendar, on which the student can modify and put in remainder the events that they desire. The platform will require creating an account to use some features. This account will require the institutional email for the students, the account can be created with other email, but this will be limited to certain features, an example of this will be a landlord posting their apartments nearby the university.
